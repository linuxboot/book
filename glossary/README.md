|BIOS             |Originally, BIOS was the software built into computers to send simple instructions to the hardware, allowing input and output before the operating system was loaded. It was a binary blob with no standardized structure that was responsible for initializing CPU and memory, and jumping to a hard-coded position on the master block of the first disk drive. BIOS has been largely replaced by UEFI. Many UEFI implementations still offer a "BIOS compatibility mode" which makes it behave like an old BIOS, with its features.|
|busybox          |Busybox is a single userspace binary which includes versions of a large number of system commands, including a shell. This package can be very useful for recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those involving broken shared libraries. There are multiple implementations of busybox, such as git.busybox.net/busybox and github.com/u-root/u-root.|
|[coreboot](https://doc.coreboot.org/)|coreboot is a project to develop open source boot firmware for various architectures. Its design philosophy is to do the bare minimum necessary to ensure that hardware is usable and then pass control to a different program called the payload. The payload can then provide user interfaces, file system drivers, various policies etc. to load the OS.|
