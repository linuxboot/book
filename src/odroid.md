# ODROID boot chain

The [ODROID-N2](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-n2/hardware) comes with a SPI
flash as well as a connector for an eMMC flash and an SD card slot. The SoC is
an [Amlogic S922X which can boot from all those storages](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-n2/software/boot_sequence),
depending on GPIO configuration and a fallback flow in the mask ROM.
For booting from SPI flash, the ODROID-N2 board has a switch, and comes with
[Petitboot](./petitboot.md) preinstalled[^1].

The SPI flash boot flows is as follows:

flowchart LR
    maskrom["mask ROM"]
    spl["U-Boot SPL"]
    uboot["U-Boot main"]
    petitboot(["petitboot"])
    maskrom-->spl-->uboot-->petitboot-->OS
```

- [U-Boot SPL](https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/usage/spl_boot.html)
  initializes DRAM and loads U-Boot main ("proper")
- U-Boot main is set up to directly load Linux with Petitboot, which implements
  LinuxBoot
