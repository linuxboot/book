This case study describes information for firmware development community to use
[OCP](https://www.opencompute.org/) platform TiogaPass, made by [Wiwynn
Corporation](http://www.wiwynn.com/english).

It contains following sections:

  * [Platform info](#Platform-info)
* [Support](#Support)

  * [Community support](#Community-support)
  * [Professional support](#Professional-support)

## Quick Start

* [Order the hardware](http://www.wiwynn.com/english) if you have not done so.
* Download or build the firmware binary. The current solution is to boot
  embedded Linux kernel and initramfs as UEFI payload. Please contact Wiwynn to
  get a UEFI binary after ordering.
* Flash the firmware.
  * Copy the downloaded firmware to OpenBMC.
  * From OpenBMC
    ```
      fw-util mb --update bios --force ./<firmware image name>
    ```
* Boot and enjoy.
  * From OpenBMC
    ```
      power-util mb reset
      sol-util mb
    ```

## Details

### How to build

Follow [Build Details](#Build-Details) for details on how to get the source
code, and how to build.

Boot flow of the current firmware solution is: Power on → minimized UEFI →
Linuxboot → target OS.

In near feature, the boot flow will be: power on → Coreboot → Linuxboot →
target OS.

#### Build Details

* Download the code from [linuxboot github](https://github.com/linuxboot/linuxboot)
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/linuxboot/linuxboot.git
  ```
* You need to apply Wiwiynn's linuxboot patch for now
  ```
  cd linuxboot
  wget -O TiogaPass.patch https://github.com/johnnylinwiwynn/linuxboot/commit/28ae8450b3b05c6e6b8c74e29d0974ccf711d5e6.patch
  git am TiogaPass.patch
  ```
* Build the kernel bzImage (has embedded initramfs) for linuxboot, please
  reference [Building u-root](https://github.com/linuxboot/book/tree/master/coreboot.u-root.systemboot#building-u-root)
  and [Building a suitable Linux kernel](https://github.com/linuxboot/book/tree/master/coreboot.u-root.systemboot#building-a-suitable-linux-kernel)
  for how to build the bzImage. You can always customize your Linux kernel
  configuration to suit your needs, please reference Wiwynn's kernel
  configuration file as a sample [linux_config](linux_config).
* Place the tioga.rom into linuxboot/boards/tioga which is provided from Wiwynn
  after ordering, and also put your bzImage to the root folder of linuxboot,
  and then make
  ```
    cp path/to/tioga.rom linuxboot/boards/tioga
    cp path/to/bzImage linuxboot
    cd linuxboot
    BOARD=tioga make
  ```
* You should see the built image at build/tioga/linuxboot.rom.

### How to operate

Follow **TBD section** for details on:

* How to flash. The image can be flashed either out-of-band, or from Linuxboot
  u-root shell, or from targetOS shell.
* How to run Linuxboot u-root shell commands.

### Platform info

The SKU contains TiogaPass board, a debug card, a VGA card, a power adapter.
The details can be obtained from the [Wiwynn Corporation](http://www.wiwynn.com/english).
