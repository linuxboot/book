# u-root, what it is and why it is

Points of contact: [Ronald Minnich](https://github.com/rminnich)

This chapter describes u-root, what it is, and why it is the way it is.

## Quick Start

Get u-root

	$ go get -u github.com/u-root/u-root

Build a u-root initramfs in busybox mode.

	$ go run github.com/u-root/u-root -build=bb
	2019/02/11 18:29:00 Build environment: GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux GOROOT=/home/rminnich/go GOPATH=/home/rminnich/gopath CGO_ENABLED=0
	2019/02/11 18:29:00 Filename is /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
	2019/02/11 18:29:12 Successfully wrote initramfs.

This command scans all the u-root source code with the GO AST package, converting commands into packages, and compiling them into one binary. It takes around fifteen seconds.  It creates a file called /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio. To test it, you need to install the testramfs command. 

	$ go install github.com/u-root/u-root/scripts/testramfs
	
You can then run it. 

	$ sudo $GOPATH/bin/testramfs -i /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
	... lots of messages
	 Created mount -t "cgroup" -o perf_event "cgroup" "/sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event" flags 0x0
	 2019/02/11 18:30:31 Done Rootfs
	 open /home/rminnich/.elvish/rc.elv: no such file or directory
	 (unreachable)/home/rminnich/projects/linuxboot/book/10.u-root#

This will drop you into an interactive session. You can try again with dynamic compilation (we show **-build=source** but that is the default; you do not need to type it):

	$ go run github.com/u-root/u-root -build=source
	2019/02/11 18:33:50 Build environment: GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux GOROOT=/home/rminnich/go GOPATH=/home/rminnich/gopath CGO_ENABLED=0
	2019/02/11 18:33:50 Filename is /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
	2019/02/11 18:33:50 Collecting package files and dependencies...
	2019/02/11 18:34:12 Building go toolchain...
	2019/02/11 18:34:41 Successfully wrote initramfs.

Note that on this second run of the u-root command, since the commands are compiled dynamically, the command also builds and includes a full Go toolchain. Even in this case, the full process takes less than a minute.
	
	$ sudo $GOPATH/bin/testramfs -i /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
	(same as before)

You can see the effects of dynamic compilation. The bootup is longer since packages are compiled on boot; also, the first time you run a command, it takes about 1/4 second to compile, and the second time, it is running a binary in a tmpfs, so is very fast.  The nice part is that you can see all the source, and change it. You can also create new programs and run them. 

This extra power comes at a cost: dynamic images with all the commands are about 13M xz-compressed; static images are 6M. This size difference only matters for firmware images, however.

## Components

U-root runs on several operating systems but the main target is Linux and, given that this is the
linuxboot book, we will restrict our discussion to Linux.

U-root can be used as a separate initramfs for Linux, or built into Linux; it can be started long after boot,
or as part of boot; it can be an initramfs on a disk, or in a UEFI firmware volume, or a coreboot CBFS, or
in an IBM firmware image, replacing Petitboot. It works on x86, x86-64, ARM, ARM64, and Power, although it should run
on any system supporting Go 1.10 or later.

The commands in u-root initramfs can be there in source form or in binary. In the binary form, which we call bb mode,
the commands are compiled into on binary.

## Building u-root

The first step is building the initramfs. You can then test the initramfs standalone, under kvm, or on real hardware.

You should have at least the 1.10 version of Go.
Both `u-root` and `systemboot` are written in Go. We recommend using a relatively recent version of Go. At the time of writing the latest is 1.11, and we recommend using at least version 1.10. Previous versions may not be fully supported.

Adjust your `PATH` to include `${GOPATH}/bin`, in order to find the `u-root` command that we will use in the next steps.

```
go get -u github.com/u-root/u-root
```

You need to set a few things up before you build.
U-root is designed to be a pure Go systems, no C libraries allowed; further, we need to
fix up the path and prepare to build our own Go toolchain in dynamic mode.
My Go toolchain source tree is in
```
~/gohead
```

and my source is in
```
~/go
```

so the script I source for setup looks like this:

```
export GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=/usr/lib/go
PATH=~rminnich/gohead/bin:$PATH
export GOPATH=~rminnich/go
export CGO_ENABLED=0
```

To build the ramfs for dynamic mode:
```
u-root
```

To build the ramfs in busybox mode:
```
u-root -build=bb
```

This builds an initramfs in
```
/tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
```

Note that if you want to build for ARM64:
```
GOARCH=arm64 u-root
```

You can test the initramfs if it's being built for the machine you are on with the testramfs program:
```
go install github.com/u-root/u-root/scripts/testramfs
sudo ~/go/bin/testramfs -i /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
```

If you are building on ARM, this works on ARM systems too, of course, with a slight change of name:
```
sudo ~/go/bin/testramfs -i /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
```

If you want to test it with qemu, that's pretty easy, here is an example on my ubuntu system:
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-39-generic  -initrd /tmp/initramfs.linux_amd64.cpio
```

### But why? We have busybox, right? Why do this?

In this next section, we present the motivation for the creation of u-root. This text is from our original
paper ast the Usenix Annual Technical Conference in 2019,
"U-root: A Go-based, Firmware Embeddable Root File System with On-demand Compilation", by Ron Minnich and Andrey Mirtchovski.
https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-session/presentation/minnich

### Abstract

U-root is an embeddable root file system intended to be placed in a
FLASH device as part of the firmware image, along with a Linux
kernel. The program source code is installed in the root file system
contained in the firmware FLASH part and compiled on demand. All the
u-root utilities, roughly corresponding to standard Unix utilities,
are written in Go, a modern, type-safe language with garbage
collection and language-level support for concurrency and
inter-process communication.  Unlike most embedded root file systems,
which consist largely of binaries, U-root has only five: an init
program and 4 Go compiler binaries. When a program is first run, it
and any not-yet-built packages it uses are compiled to a RAM-based
file system. The first invocation of a program takes a fraction of a
second, as it is compiled. Packages are only compiled once, so the
slowest build is always the first one, on boot, which takes about 3
seconds. Subsequent invocations are very fast, usually a millisecond
or so.

U-root blurs the line between script-based distros such as Perl
Linux[24] and binary-based distros such as BusyBox[26]; it has the
flexibility of Perl Linux and the performance of BusyBox. Scripts and
builtins are written in Go, not a shell scripting language. U-root
is a new way to package and distribute file systems for embedded
systems, and the use of Go promises a dramatic improvement in their
security.


### Introduction

Embedding kernels and root file systems in BIOS FLASH is a common
technique for gaining boot time performance and platform
customization[25][14][23]. Almost all new firmware includes a
multiprocess operating system with a full complement of file
systems, network drivers, and protocol stacks, contained in an em-
bedded file system. In some cases, the kernel is only Ronald
G. Minnich Google Andrey Mirtchovski Cisco booted long enough to boot
another kernel; in others, the kernel that is booted and the file
system it contains constitute the operational environment of the
device[15].  These so-called “embedded root file systems” also contain
a set of standard Unix-style programs used for both normal operation
and maintenance. Space on the device is at a premium, so these
programs are usually written in C using, e.g., the BusyBox
toolkit[26]; or in an interpretive languages, such as Perl[24] or
Forth. BusyBox in particular has found wide usage in embedded ap-
pliance environments, as the entire root file system can be contained
in under one MiB.  Embedded systems, which were once standalone, are
now almost always network connected. Networkconnected systems face a
far more challenging security environment than even a few years
ago. In response to the many successful attacks against shell
interpreters[11] and C programs[8], we have started to look at using a
more secure, modern language in embedded root file systems, namely,
Go[21][16].  Go is a new systems programming language created by
Google. Go has strong typing; language level support for concurrency;
inter-process communication via channels, a la Occam[13], Limbo[17],
and Alef[27]; runtime type safety and other protective measures;
dynamic allocation and garbage collection; closures; and a package
syntax, similar to Java, that makes it easy to determine what packages
a given program needs.  The modern language constructs make Go a much
safer language than C. This safety is critical for network-attached
embedded systems, which usually have network utilities written in C,
including web servers, network servers including sshd, and programs
that provide access to a command interpreter, itself written in
C. All are proving to be vulnerable to the attack-rich environment
that the Internet has become. Buffer overflow attacks affecting
C-based firmware code (among other things) in 2015 include GHOST and
the so-called FSVariable.c bug in Intel’s UEFI firmware. Buffer
overflows in Intel’s USENIX Association 2015 USENIX Annual Technical
Conference 577

UEFI and Active Management Technology (AMT)have also been discovered
in several versions in recent years. Both UEFI[12] and AMT[4] are
embedded operating systems, loaded from FLASH, that run network-facing
software; attacks against UEFI have been extensively studied[9]. Most
printers are network-attached and are a very popular exploitation
target[6].  Firmware is not visible to most users and is updated
much less frequently (if at all) than programs. It is the first
software to run, at power on reset. Exploits in firmware are
extremely difficult to detect, because firmware is designed to be as
invisible as possible. Firmware is extremely complex; UEFI is roughly
equivalent in size and capability to a Unix kernel. Firmware is
usually closed and proprietary, with nowhere near the level of testing
of kernels. These properties make firmware an ideal place for
so-called advanced persistent threats[10][18][5]. Once an exploit is
installed, it is almost impossible to remove, since the exploit can
inhibit its removal by corrupting the firmware update process. The
only sure way to mitigate a firmware exploit is to destroy the
hardware.

Even the most skilled programmers make simple mistakes that in C can
be fatal, especially on networkconnected systems; nowadays, even the
lowest-level firmware in our PCs, printers, and thermostats is
network-connected. These mistakes are either impossible to make in
Go or, if made, are detected at runtime and result in the program
exiting. Perhaps surprisingly, the case for using a high-level, safe
language like Go in very low level embedded firmware might be stronger
than for user programs, because exploits at the firmware level are
nearly impossible to detect and mitigate.  The challenge to using Go
in a storage-constrained environment such as firmware is that
advanced language features lead to big binaries. Even a date program
is about 2 MiB. One Go binary, implementing one function, is twice
as large as a BusyBox binary implementing many functions. As of this
writing, a typical BIOS FLASH part is 16 MiB. Fitting many Go binaries
into a single BIOS flash part is not practical.  The Go compiler is
very fast and its sheer speed points to a solution: to compile
programs only when they are used. We can build a root file system
which has almost no binaries except the Go compiler itself. The
compiled programs and packages can be saved to a RAM-based file
system.

U-root is our proof of concept of this idea. U-root contains only 5
binaries, 4 of them from the Go toolchain, and the 5th an init
binary. The rest of the programs are contained in BIOS FLASH in source
form, including packages. The search path is arranged so that when a
command is invoked, if it is not in /bin, an installer is invoked
instead which compiles the program into /bin; if the build succeeds,
the command is executed. This first invocation takes a fraction of a
second, depending on program complexity; after that, the RAM-based,
statically linked binaries run in about a millisecond.  U-root blurs
the boundary between script-based root file systems such as Perl
Linux[24] and binary-based root file systems such as BusyBox[26]; it
has the flexibility of Perl Linux and the performance of
BusyBox. Scripts are written in Go, not a shell scripting language,
with two benefits: the shell can be simple, with fewer corner cases;
and the scripting environment is substantially improved, since Go is
more powerful than most shell scripting languages, but also less
fragile and less prone to parsing bugs.

### The U-root design

The u-root boot image is a build toolchain and a set of programs in
source form. When first used, a program and any needed but
not-yet-built packages are built and installed, typically in a
fraction of a second. On second and later uses, the binary is
executed. The root file system is almost entirely unformed on boot;
/init sets up the key directories and mounts, including common ones
such as /etc and /proc.

Since the init program itself is only 132 lines of code and is easy to
change, the structure is very flexible and allows for many use cases.

• Additional binaries: if the 3 seconds it takes to get to a shell is
  too long (some applications such as automotive computing require
  800 ms startup time), and there is room in FLASH, some programs can
  be precompiled into /bin.

• Builditallonboot:ifon-demandcompilationisnot desired, a background
  thread in the init process can build all the programs on boot.

• Selectively remove binaries after use: if RAM space is at a premium,
  once booted, a script can remove everything in /bin; those things
  that are used will be rebuilt on demand.

• Always build on demand: it is possible to run in a mode in which
  programs are never written to /bin and always rebuilt on demand;
  this mode is surprisingly comfortable to use, given that program
  compilation is so fast1.

• Lockdown: if desired, the system can be locked down once booted in
  one of several ways: the entire /src tree can be removed, for
  example, or just the compiler toolchain can be deleted.

### How u-root works

U-root is packaged as an LZMA-compressed initial RAM file system
(initramfs) in cpio format, contained in a Linux compressed kernel
image, a.k.a. bzImage. The bootloader (e.g. syslinux) or firmware
(e.g. coreboot) loads the bzImage into memory and starts it. The Linux
kernel sets up a RAM-based root file system and unpacks the u-root
file system into it. This initial root file system contains a Go
toolchain (4 binaries), an init binary, the uroot program source,
and the entire Go source tree, which provides packages needed for
u-root programs.

All Unix systems start an init process on boot and uroot is no
exception. The init for u-root sets up some basic directories,
symlinks, and files; builds a command installer; and invokes the
shell. We describe this process in more detail below. The boot file
system layout is shown in Table 1.

The src directory is where programs and u-root packages live. The
go/bin directory is for any Go tools built after boot; the go/pkg/tool
directory contains binaries for various architecture/kernel
combinations. The directory in which a compiler toolchain is placed
provides information about the target OS and architecture; for exam-
ple, the Go build places binaries for Linux on x86 64 in in
/go/pkg/tool/linux amd64/. Note that there is no /bin or many of the
other directories expected in a root file system. The init binary
builds them. The u-root root file system has very little state.

For most programs to work, the file system must be more complete. We
save space in the image by having init create additional file system
structure at boot time: it fills in the missing parts of the root
filesystem. It creates /dev and /proc and mounts them. It creates an
empty /bin which is filled with binaries on demand. We show it in
Table 2.  Note that in addition to /bin, there is a directory called
/buildbin. Buildbin and the correct setup of $PATH are the keys to
making on-demand compilation work. The init process sets $PATH to
/go/bin:/bin:/buildbin:/usr/local/bin. Init also builds the
installcommand, using the go bootstrap builder; and creates a complete
set of symlinks as shown. As a final step, init execs sh.

There is no /bin/sh at this point; the first sh found in $PATH is
/buildbin/sh. This is a symlink to installcommand. Installcommand,
once started, examines argv[0], which is sh, and takes this as
instruction to build /src/cmds/sh/*.go into /bin and then exec
/bin/sh. There is no difference between starting the first shell and
any other program.  Hence, part of the boot process involves the
construction of an installation tool to build a binary for a shell
which is then run. If a user wants to examine the source to the shell,
they can cat /src/cmds/sh/*.go; the cat command will be built and
then show those files.  U-root is intended for network-based devices,
and hence good network initialization code is essential. Uroot
includes a Go version of the ip and dhcp programs, along with the
docker netlink package and a dhcp package. Support for WIFI
configuration is underway.

### The u-root shell (left in for historical purposes ...)

A shell is a key part of any boot system. Shells run commands, where
a command is a sequence of one or more programs, potentially tied
together with pipes or other operators. Shells may run scripts from a
file. Scripts are usually simple sequences of commands, each command
invoking just one program, but the shell language may allow more
complex commands in a script. Shells have built-in commands,
i.e. commands that do not invoke a program, but are recognized by the
shell and executed directly. Builtins are used when the command must
change the shell state, as in the cd command; when the cost of
starting a program is felt to be too high relative to the operation
the command performs; because the shell source is not available or it
is too hard to change the shell; or for convenience, i.e. users would
rather write in the shell language instead of C. Most shells can be
extended via a builtin facility, which usually looks like a function
definition style syntax. The shell scripting language is usually the
same language used for builtins.

Every boot loader in common use today has some sort of shell
capability. That these shells have many limitations is a given, but
at the same time they need to look as much as possible like a standard
shell.  U-root provides a shell that is stripped down to the fun-
damentals: it can read commands in, using the Go scanner package; it
can expand (i.e. glob) the command elements, using the Go filepath
package; and it can run the resulting commands, either programs or
shell builtins. It supports pipelines and IO redirection. At the same
time, the shell defines no language of its own for scripting and
builtins; instead, the u-root shell uses the Go compiler. In that
sense, the u-root shell reflects a break in important ways with the
last few decades of shell development, which has seen shells and their
language grow ever more complex and, partially as a result, ever more
insecure[19] and fragile[11].

The shell has several builtin commands, and the user can extend it
with builtin commands of their own. Before we discuss user-defined
builtins, we will describe the basic source structure of u-root shell
builtins.  All shell builtins, including the ones that come with the
shell by default, are written with a standard Go init pattern which
installs one or more builtins. Shown in Figure 1 and 2 is the shell
builtin for time.

Builtins in the shell are defined by a name and a function. One or
more builtins can be described in a source file. The name is kept in a
map and the map is searched for a command name before looking in the
file system. The function must accept a string as a name and a (possi-
bly zero-length) array of string arguments, and return an error. In
order to connect the builtin to the map, the programmer must provide
an init function which adds the name and function to the map. The init
function is special in that it is run by Go when the program starts
up. In this case, the init function just installs a builtin for the
time command.

## Scripting and builtins
```
// Package main is the ’root’ of the
// package hierarchy for a program.
// This code is part of the main
// program , not another package ,
// and is declared as package main.
package main
// A Go source file lists
// all the packages on which
// it has a direct dependency.
import (
       ”fmt”
       ”os”
       ”time”
)      
}
// If init() is present in a file,
// the Go compiler and runtime
// arrange for it to be called
// at program startup.
// It is hence like a constructor.
// init () is an optional function.

func init() {

// addBuiltIn is provided by the u−root shell for
// the addition of builtin commands.
// Builtins must have a standard type:
// The first parameter is a string
// The second is a string array which may be 0 length
// The return is the Go error type
// In this case, we are creating a builtin
// called time which calls the timecmd function.

   addBuiltIn (”time” , timecmd)
}
```

To support scripting and builtins, u-root provides two programs:
script and builtin. The script program allows users to specify a Go
fragment on the command line, and runs that fragment as a program. The
builtin program allows a Go fragment to be built into the shell as a
new command. Builtins are persistent; the builtin command instantiates
a new shell with the new command built in. Scripts run via the
script command are ephemeral.

We show a usage of the script command in Figure 3.

This script implements printenv. Note that it is not a complete Go program in that it lacks a package statement, imports, a main function declaration, and a return at the end. All the boilerplate is added by the script command, which uses the Go imports package to scan the code and create the import statements required for compilation (in this case, both fmt and os packages are imported). Because our shell is so simple, there is no need to escape many of these special characters. We have offloaded the complex parsing tasks to Go.
Builtins are implemented in almost the same way. The builtin command takes the Go fragment and creates a standard shell builtin Go source file which conforms to the builtin pattern. This structure is easy to generate programmatically, building on the techniques used for the script command.

A basic hello builtin can be defined on the command line:
```
builtin hello ’{ fmt.Printf(”Hello\n”) }'
```

The fragment is defined by the {} pair. Given a fragment that starts
with a {, the builtin command generates all the wrapper boiler plate
needed. The builtin command is slightly different from the script
command in that the Go fragment is bundled into one argument. The
command accepts multiple pairs of command name and Go code

| return nil } | |

fragments, allowing multiple new builtin commands to be installed in the shell.

Builtin creates a new shell at /bin/sh with the source at
/src/cmds/sh/. Invocations of /bin/sh by this shell and its children
will use the new shell. Processes spawned by this new shell can access
the new shell source and can run the builtin command again and cre-
ate a shell that further extends the new shell. Processes outside the
new shell’s process hierarchy can not use this new shell or the
builtin source. When the new shell exits, the builtins are no longer
visible in any part of the file system. We use Linux mount name spaces
to create this effect[22]. Once the builtin command has verified
that the Go fragment is valid, it builds a new, private namespace
with the shell source, including the new builtin source. From that
point on, the new shell and its children will only use the new
shell. The parent process and other processes outside the private
namespace continue to use the old shell.

### Environment variables

The u-root shell supports environment variables, but manages them
differently than most Unix environments. The variables are maintained
in a directory called /env; the file name corresponds to the
environment variable name, and the files contents are the value. When
it is starting a new process, the shell populates child process
environment variables from the /env directory. The syntax is the
same; $ followed by a name directs the shell to substitute the value
of the variable in the argument by prepending /env to the path and
reading the file.

The shell variables described above are relative paths; /env is
prepended to them. In the u-root shell, the name can also be an
absolute path. For example, the command script
$/home/rminnich/scripts/hello
willsubstitute the value of the hello
script into the command line and then run the script command. The
ability to place arbitrary text from a file into an argument is
proving to be extremely convenient, especially for script and builtin
commands.

### Using external packages and programs

No root file system can provide all the packages all users want, and
u-root is no exception. We must have the ability to load external
packages from popular Linux distros. As a proof of concept, we created
a tool to load external packages from the TinyCore Linux
distribution, a.k.a. tinycore. A tinycore package is a mountable file
system image, containing all the package files, including a file
listing any additional package dependencies.  To load these packages,
u-root provides the tcz command which fetches the package and and
needed dependencies. Hence, if a user wants emacs, they need merely
type tcz emacs, and emacs will become available in /us-
r/local/bin. The tinycore packages directory can be a persistent
directory or it can be empty on each boot.

The tcz command is quite flexible as to what packages it loads and
where they are loaded from. Users may specify the host name which
provides the packages; the TCP port on which to connect; the version
of tinycore to use; and the architecture. The tcz command must loop-
back mount each package as it is fetched, and hence must cache them
locally. It will not refetch already cached packages. This cache can
be volatile or maintained on more permanent storage. Performance
varies depending on the network being used and the number of packages
being loaded, but seems to average about 1 second per package on a
WIFI-attached laptop.  U-root also provides a small web server, called
srvfiles, that can be used to serve locally cached tinycore packages
for testing. The entire server is 18 lines of Go.

### Usability

We have been using u-root for a few months. The system provides a very
usable firmware command line environment, comparable to what we have
used with U-boot, UEFI, and Open Firmware. The u-root and its shell
provide familiar tools and capabilities. The ability to start
background tasks, shell pipelines, and redirect output to files is
both useful and unusual in an embedded environment. In terms of
scripting, it is more sophisticated than any shell we know of, given
that our scripting language is Go.

The script command is more powerful than we first realized. It is
possible to run it under any shell, or from any program. It can use
much more powerful Go fragments than we have shown here, including
whole Go programs, since its internal parsing is just the standard Go
”imports” library. The script command fills in the blanks as needed,
but only as needed.  The builtin command is perhaps the most powerful
tool in u-root. It allows users to build fully customized shells for a
specific purpose and then just as quickly discard them. The new
shell is ready and running in less than a second. We could apply this
technique to the problem of startup scripts for embedded
environments. To support standard functions in init scripts,
distributions provide several hundred files, and for each invocation
of the shell, some set of these files are included over and over
again. The time it takes to read, parse and run these standard scripts
is a large part startup time1.  With the scripting and builtin tools,
users do not need to write full Go programs to get a new
capability. We are finding that the basic set of tools we have is
enough, and we are writing new tools as Go fragments.

Once the network is up, tools like emacs can be loaded either via a
local disk, local network package server, or a remote server such as
tinycorelinux.org.  Having the source always available in any sort of
firmware environment is both unusual and very useful. At times, we
have forgotten how some of our commands work. Having the source at
hand has proven very helpful.

### Future development

While we envisioned u-root as a boot time environment, we have seen
increasing interest in wider use. Some users have requested common
features as tab completion. The shell parser is written in such a way
that it should allow for easy addition of tab completion.  History
is another question, as it adds more state, complexity, and parsing
to the shell. These additions in turn decrease reliability and open up
paths for exploits. We 1A good discussion can be found in http://free-
electrons.com/doc/training/boot-time/boot-time-slides.pdf are
experimenting with new models of history maintenance that do not
require the complexity of current systems. We might, for example,
maintain history in a private per-process or per-user
directory. Finding commands becomes easy, and with our extension to
the shell variable model, running an old command becomes easy:
$/home/rminnich/history/5 would run the fifth command. Another
attraction of this model is that conversion of an old command into a
shell script is easy. History stops being special to one shell and
instead is common to all programs that can traverse files. Any program
can see history and use the commands.  Instead of rereading the same
scripts over and over, init could build a special shell at boot time
that pulls in builtins to extend the shell. The scripts themselves
would continue to be human-readable, but the performance of booting
would be much faster, combining the perceived advantages of
upstart-style scripting with systemd-level performance.

### Related work

There are two main components to this work: on-demand compilaton and
embedding a kernel and root file system in FLASH. Both ideas have been
used at different times. Our work combines the two so that we can use
Go. We review the earlier work below.

### On-Demand Compilation

On-Demand compilation is one of the oldest ideas in computer science.
Slimline Open Firmware (SLOF)[7] is a FORTHbased implementation of
Open Firmware developed by IBM for some of its Power and Cell
processors. SLOF is capable of storing all of Open Firmware as source
in the FLASH memory and compiling components to indirect threading on
demand[2].  In the last few decades, as our compiler infrastructure
has gotten slower and more complex, true on-demand compilation has
split into two different forms. First is the on-demand compilation of
source into executable byte codes, as in Python. The byte codes are
not native but are more efficient than source. If the python
interpreter finds the byte code it will interpret that instead of
source to provide improved performance.  Java takes the process one
step further with the Just In Time compilation of byte code to machine
code[20] to boost performance.  8 584 2015 USENIX Annual Technical

### Embedding kernel and root file systems in FLASH

The LinuxBIOS project[14][1], together with clustermatic[25], used an
embedded kernel and simple root file system to manage supercomputing
clusters. Due to space constraints of 1 MiB or less of FLASH, clusters
embedded only a single-processor Linux kernel with a daemon. The
daemon was a network bootloader that downloaded a more complex SMP
kernel and root file system and started them. Clusters built this way
were able to boot 1024 nodes in the time it took the standard PXE
network boot firmware to find a working network interface.

Early versions of One Laptop Per Child used LinuxBIOS, with Linux in
flash as a boot loader, to boot the eventual target. This system was
very handy, as they were able to embed a full WIFI stack in flash with
Linux, and could boot test OLPC images over WIFI. The continuing
growth of the Linux kernel, coupled with the small FLASH size on OLPC,
eventually led OLPC to move to Open Firmware.

AlphaPower shipped their Alpha nodes with a socalled Direct Boot
Linux, or DBLX. This work was never published, but the code was
partially released on sourceforge.net just as AlphaPower went out of
business. Compaq also worked with a Linux-As-Bootloader for the iPaq.

Car computers and other embedded ARM systems frequently contain a
kernel and an ext2 formatted file system in NOR FLASH, i.e. FLASH
that can be treated as memory instead of a block device. Many of these
kernels use the so-called eXecute In Place[3] (XIP) patch, which
allows the kernel to page binaries directly from the
memory-addressable FLASH rather than copying it to RAM, providing a
significant savings in system startup time. A downside of this
approach is that the executables can not be compressed, which puts
further pressure on the need to optimize binary size. NOR FLASH is
very slow, and paging from it comes at a significant performance
cost. Finally, an uncompressed binary image stored in NOR FLASH has a
much higher monetary cost than the same image stored in RAM since the
cost per bit is so much higher.

UEFI[12] contains a non-Linux kernel (the UEFI firmware binary) and a
full set of drivers, file systems, network protocol stacks, and
command binaries in the firmware image. It is a full operating system
environment realized as firmware.

The ONIE project[23] is a more recent realization of the
Kernel-in-FLASH idea, based on Linux. ONIE packs a Linux kernel and
Busybox binaries into a very small package. Since the Linux build
process allows an initial RAM file system (initramfs) to be built
directly into the kernel binary, some companies are now embedding ONIE
images into FLASH with coreboot. Sage Engineering has shown a
bzImage with a small Busybox packed into a 4M image. ONIE has brought
new life to an old idea: packaging a kernel and small set of binaries
in FLASH to create a fast, capable boot system.

### Conclusions and future work

U-root is a root file system targeted to embedded firmware
environments. In response to the increasing security challenges
facing embedded systems in the always-connected Internet of Things, we
have chosen to write all the u-root programs in Go, a modern, type
safe language with garbage collection. The safety of the Go language
and runtime reduce many of the security risks of writing
network-facing services. The performance of the Go compiler makes
on-demand compilation practical: most commands compile in a fraction
of a second and, once compiled, run in about a millisecond.

The U-root file system, on boot, contains only 5 binaries. The rest
of the root file system contains source to programs which are compiled
on demand. We have found the system to be fast and usable. The images
can be tested in emulation environments, of increasing fidelity to the
firmware target, and have been tested on hardware running coreboot.

Our initial intent was to use u-root to build firmware images, but we
are finding that we would like to use it more broadly. The structure
of the Go toolchain naming scheme lends itself to heterogeneous
environments: save for init, the toolchain binaries have a directory
path name that includes the name of the target OS and architecture,
e.g. linux amd64, linux arm, and so on. A single u-root image can
contain many Go toolchains with no path conflicts. Were we to install
more toolchains in the root file system, and move /init to the same
directory containing the toolchain, a single u-root file system
image could be used on many different OS and architecture
combinations. We could build a u-root image, for example, that worked
on all linux variants for different architectures. We are exploring
this model now.
