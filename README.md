# The LinuxBoot Book

LinuxBoot is a project that aims to replace specific firmware functionality with
a Linux kernel and runtime. Over the years this project has grown to include 
various initiatives with the overarching goal of moving from obscure, complex 
firmware to simpler, open source firmware. 

This is the official site of documentation for the LinuxBoot project. The book 
provides guidance on how to get started, and gives overviews and 
background on the different aspects of LinuxBoot.
